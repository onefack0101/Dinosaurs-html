Dinosaurs belong to a group known as archosaurs, which also includes modern crocodilians.
Within the archosaur group, dinosaurs are differentiated most noticeably by their gait.
<strong>Dinosaur legs extend directly beneath the body,</strong> whereas the legs of lizards and crocodilians sprawl out to either side.
<p style="margin-top:15px;">Collectively, dinosaurs as a clade are divided into two primary branches, Saurischia and Ornithischia.
  Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia, while Ornithischia includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with Triceratops than with Saurischia.</p>
<p style="margin-top:15px;">
  Anatomically, these two groups can be distinguished most noticeably by their pelvic structure. <u>Early saurischians—"lizard-hipped", from the Greek sauros (σαῦρος) meaning "lizard" and ischion (ἰσχίον) meaning "hip joint"—retained the hip structure of their ancestors, with a pubis bone directed cranially, or forward.</u>
  This basic form was modified by rotating the pubis backward to varying degrees in several groups (Herrerasaurus, therizinosauroids, dromaeosaurids, and <strong>birds</strong>).
  Saurischia includes the theropods (exclusively bipedal and with a wide variety of diets) and sauropodomorphs (long-necked herbivores which include advanced, quadrupedal groups).
